   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Numerical-Lab-Assignments.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd Numerical-Lab-Assignments
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
6. Open the desired `.ipynb` file and run the cells.
